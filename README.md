## Utilities to use youtube-dl and the videos I watch

### Watched videos

#### Algorithms and data structures

##### CSE373 2012 - Introduction to Algorithms

This is a course held by prof Skiena, it's a regular university course so it's pretty long, I've liked it as it gave me
some background on the matter, "some" because it's not an area I find particularly interesting, but if you do this might
be worth. Oh, and prepare to hear lots of "oooook"s and "any questions"s.
