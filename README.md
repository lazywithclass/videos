## Utilities to use youtube-dl and the videos I watch


### [Funtional programming](Anjana Vakil: Learning Functional Programming with JavaScript - JSUnconf 2016)

Anjana went to the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) as me, this was already interesting enough to give her talk a go. 
It's an introductory talk if you're approaching functional programming and want to know what it is about, with some examples 
expecially on [map / reduce](https://youtu.be/e-5obm1G_FY?t=678) which instantly give you an idea.
Tough croud though, didn't really reacted in any way.


### Algorithms and data structures

#### [CSE373 2012 - Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFjhkohHdAA&list=PLOtl7M3yp-DV69F32zdK7YJcNXpTunF2b)

This is a course held by prof Skiena, it's a regular university course so it's pretty long, I've liked it as it gave me
some background on the matter, "some" because it's not an area I find particularly interesting, but if you do this might
be worth. Oh, and prepare to hear lots of "oooook"s and "any questions"s.


### Science

#### [Cosmos - A Spacetime Odyssey](https://www.netflix.com/watch/80004601)

From Neil Degrasse Tyson, I love the series. It's not fun-oriented but they keep it interesting at every episode. Also 
Neil's voice is pretty calming. 

#### [Inside Black Holes | Leonard Susskind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMRYZMv0jRE)

I am not sure why I watched this video, I think the title and the fact that it looked sciency prompted me to.
I didn't get most of it, but it's fascinating listening to someone talking about their craft.
It's particularly fascinating how he describes a black hole as seen by an external viewer, picturing it as 
layers and layers of sediments consisting of things that got attracted and never made it past the even horizon; and also
how it takes a finite amount of time to fall through the horizon for an in flowing observer and an infinite amount of
time as seen by the outside.
There's lots of information near the horizon!
One of the things I probably misunderstood the most is that distant Hawking could be  a description of the interior of a black hole,
which sounds amazing.


### TDD

#### [The Three Laws of TDD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoIfc5NwRks)

It's an introduction to TDD, with some theory and some examples on how to use it.

 * You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass

Which means you have to write the test first.

 * You are not allowed to write any any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; ad compilation failures are failures
 * You are not allowed to write any any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test
 
Unit tests as examples of how your code works.
If you write the tests first it's impossible to write a function that's hard to test, functions are written to be easy to test. 
The goal of TDD is to create a test suite such that when it passes you can deploy.
A reliable test suite that passes allows you to make decisions.

TDD is a way to incrementally derive solutions to problems.
