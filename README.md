some background on the matter, "some" because it's not an area I find particularly interesting, but if you do this might

It's an introductory talk if you're approaching functional programming and want to know what it is about, with some examples

</summary>

This is one of those talks that give you lots of resources to expand the subject.
They speak about how you should structure your code with functions intended as consumers and producers.
What I've missed is examples, code examples you could start from to apply the concepts expressed in the talk.

You could "summarise" it like so:

 * whole values
 * combining forms
 * simple laws
 * functions as representations

If you don't know what that means you're not alone, this is what I meant when I said that this talk gives
you lots of resources to expand your knowledge.

</summary>

Hire juniors. They inspire seniors to work better, they get trained and they can learn more than seniors usually do.
Why learning functional programming? Because simplicity allows to:

 * reason about code
 * test code
 * prove our code
 * trust our code

Functional programming languages usually limit the power of the user, wink wink to Out Of The Tar Pit.
In functional programming our state is exposed, if it's too complex, it's there as a parameter, so it's much easier
to spot.
Do everything you can without side effects, don't mutate variables, don't handle state (your state should be just in
the tests), compose your functions, then, once you're done introduce side effects.
So our business logic almost never depends on other libraries, while our side effects logic almost exclusively libraries
so we don't have to run unit tests around them.
He also introduces the concept of mob programming.
I feel there's lots of wisdom pearls in how to manage a team.

</summary>

Whirlwind tour at high speed of several concepts.

Functions are things, not really attached to classes or objets, take something in and send something out.

Composition everywhere.

Types are not classes, they're just set of inputs and outputs to functions. A name given to a set of values.

Strive for totality: for every input there's a valid output.
For example in a function that divides `12` by the given input you could do this in two ways to avoid division by zero, and the dilemma
of having to throw exception or not:

 * restrict the input with a type like `NonZeroInteger` that has all integers except `0`
 * extend the output to be optional (`Maybe` monad)

Parameterise all the things.

I *loved* what follows, I really did, he basically started with interfaces, explained how they're a bit bloated and proposed types as substitutes.

Function types are interfaces, if you add the Single Responsibility Principle (only one reason to change) and the Interface Segregation Principle
(don't contaminate interfaces with too many things) and you take that a bit to the extreme you get interfaces with just one function. But an interface
with a single function is just a funtion type, and any function that has the same signature is compatible with it, and you don't have to inherit anything,
it's automatic synce they share the signature!

Partial application, which is useful for dependency injection too allowing to bake in things like database connections.

Continuations, the Hollywood principle: don't call us we'll call you.
Let the caller decide what's going to happen, passing in functions for example to deal with the division by 0 from above.

How to combine a function that outputs two different types with one that accepts just one?
Bind all the things! (monadic bind)

Map allows you to stay in the world of options, so you could call functions on types that you're not sure what value they represent, think about
the result of an async call that returns a `Maybe`, most generic wrapped generic types have a `map`, use it! Functors are just mappable types.

"The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise."

-- Edsger Dijkstra

You don't want to have side effects buried in the code, pull them out separating them calling the side effect function elsewhere and pass
the result.

Functions should not depend on internal structure of data, pull out a new function that knows how to access fields in the data structure.

Distinguish what you calculate and how you calculate that something, pull out the structure into one place.

`null` presence considered a smell.

All functions are a single expression in Haskell and PureScript, so whatever you have in the body that's returned from the function,
and that's completely different from you have in other languages.

Typesystems as a benefit and a friend rather than something you have to please to have your code work.

Good function: isolated, doing one thing, testable. Impure functions should have a small as possible surface area.

</summary>

Referential transparency and explanation.

Immutability as a solution to multi threaded problems (locking, shared resources, ...), `ref` in Clojure seems a good
approach to this problem.

[Shallow copies and deep copies](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/184710/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deep-copy-and-a-shallow-copy).

In immutable lists if you add elements to the head then you can keep on doing so without impacting
anyone else that have a reference to the previous elements of the list. This passage is at [37:20](https://soundcloud.com/lambda-cast/episode-5-immutability#t=37:20).

So instead of "what does it mean to update and delete" we have "what does it mean to create a new state", we go from one
state to the other.

Introduction of `Maybe`, along with `Either`, to solve the `null` problem. The latter could also help to replace exceptions or
chain stuff with lots of `andThen`s. It basically lifts types to a higher state in which they could be used without worrying
about them producing a `null`, because that's being taken care of.

Cathegory theory is the explanation of why and how math works. "Math of math".
A morhpism is a function that takes a type and gives back a type, all pure functions are morphisms

 * endomorphism is a function that takes a type `A` and returns a type `A`
 * isomorphism is a morphism that could be reversed, if you have `A` to `B` you could go back from `B` to `A`; it's more than
 just types, it's about the function inner structure, as some information could be loss when going in a direction. An example
 could going from a `Float` to an `Int`: you can't go back as you've lost some information
 * homomorphism does not change the struction of your thing
 * catamorphism goes from an algebra to another algebra, where an algebra is the set of operations you can do with your thing,
 an example is moving from logs to reports

<a href="https://soundcloud.com/lambda-cast/9-polymorphism-and-abstraction">LambdaCast 9: Polymorphism And Abstraction (1:23:51)</a>
</summary>

Introducing [type parameters](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskellquestions/comments/60dlsv/type_parameters_in_haskell/).

Introducing the concept of [lenses](https://docs.racket-lang.org/lens/index.html).

"The more we know about the type, the less we know about the function; the less we know about the type, the more we know
about the function".

Let's say we have a `List Int -> Int`, what we can say about the function? Well, almost nothing, it can do a lot of things.
This is what I think they meant with the previous sentence. They go through a few different function signatures asking
"what can we tell about this function just by looking at the signature?", it's a powerful discussion that underlines
the importance of having parameters as types.

It's important to know that we know that when they say `f` of `a` `f` is not a function, it's a type; it's not `f(a)`.

If we were to throw immutability and purity away we couldn't think about functions the same way just by looking at the types,
just because we won't have the same constraints.

Parametric polymorphism and polymorphism in object oriented are two separate concepts.

Introduced the concept of functor, which they explained as something that you could `map` over. `f` is mappable is the same
as `f` is a functor.

Reusability of functions and polymoprhic types enable functions reuse, because the type is less specific.

"The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise."

<a href="https://soundcloud.com/lambda-cast/10-partial-application">LambdaCast 10: Partial Application (1:09:51)</a>
</summary>

A function must be curried to be partially applied. In terms of parameter ordering you have what could configure the function
coming first, then in the last position you want the thing you will act upon, for example you could configure a function to
save an array to the database, the first parameter could be the connection, the second the query, and probably the last
will be the array.

In languages like Haskell you see a function declared as `add :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer`, one might read it as
"`add` is a function that takes two integers and return an integer", but what that actually means is "`add` is a function that
takes an integer that returns a function that takes an integer that returns an integer".

One could imagine a partially applied function as a screwdriver with a detachable head, so you have a function (the
 headless screwdriver) and then you have different heads you could attach to it (parameters) so it's configured for a specific
 task.

They then explain the difference between code that's dense and code that's complicated. Usually in FP you're doing multiple
things on one line, that's more dense for sure, but maybe not more complicated.

<a href="https://soundcloud.com/lambda-cast/12-monoids">LambdaCast 12: Monoids (1:05:33)</a>
</summary>

A semi-group is a data type that has an operation that takes two elements of that type and merge them together to give back an
element of that type. That operation is called append.
This operation obeys the law of associativity, so `a` combined with `b` and then combined with `c` is the same as `a` combined
with `c` and then combined with `b`.
Associativity is of particular help if you need to deal with a huge list for example, because you could use divide et impera.

Integers under addition are a semigroup, integers under multiplication are a semigroup.

A monoid is a semigroup with an identity value for that data type. So for addition it's `0`, for multiplication is `1`. For arrays
it could be `[]`.

By knowing this terminology problems could be lifted in a new space where everyone speaking could bring problems from their area of
expertise into the discussion.

A function that takes an `Integer` and returns an `Integer` is also a monoid, it's composable.

In the monoid of functions that go from `a` to `a` the identity function is the identity value. It doesn't change the thing you're
composing with.

<summary>
<a href="https://soundcloud.com/lambda-cast/14-dynamic-and-static-languages">LambdaCast 14: Dynamic and Static Languages (1:17:02)</a>
</summary>
In statically typed languages the type lives on the variable, in dinamically typed languages the type lives on the value.

Benefits of dynamic languages: a team of developers from Naught Dog used hot reloading to speed up development time, writing
a game on the PS. So the emphasis is on shorter development cycles.

The faster iteration could be seen as checking things in the REPL, really fast, with immediate feedback. 

People tend to have [fewer data structures with lots of functions acting upon them](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6016271/why-is-it-better-to-have-100-functions-operate-on-one-data-structure-than-10-fun#6160116).

Benefit of static languages: a strong type system allows you to think about the type that you're wrtiing and building up
with those, helps you add more and more functionality with the guarantee that the application still works as you progress.

You write types, lots of them, and the implementation is trivial in the end, because the amount of detail that has been added
is so great that actually the compiler can even write portions of the implementation for you (Idris does this).

About abstractions: for a function that `A -> A`, the only thing you can say it's that is the identity function because you 
don't know how to construct an `A` and without side effects and global state there's no place you could pull that knowledge
from. So types helps you by restricting the amount of things a function can do.

The compiler is there to help, it's not anymore something that you have to keep happy, you want to leverage the help the 
compiler gives you.

As a final thought one might say that the time spent in the REPL in dynamic languages is somewhat "lost"; on the contrary time
spent building types remains in the code.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSsCLnLS1hg">Dependent Types in the Idris Programming Language 1 - Edwin Brady - OPLSS 2017 (1:17:25)</a>
</summary>

Edwin introduces the concept of Type Driven Development, which he also explains in
[Type Driven Development with Idris](https://www.manning.com/books/type-driven-development-with-idris); type define refine as opposed to
red green refactor.

One thing in common with Test Driven Development, it's about deciding what you're going to do before you do it.
Types are a mean by which you tell the machine "this is what we are going to work on together", it's a dialog with the machine.
Types are first class citizens as functions are in functional programming languages.

You define functions by recursively defined equations.

In type driven development you

 * write the type
 * add the definition
 * split case of the hole name

You coudl also search for a possibile implementation with the proper command.

"Just because you have types doesn't mean you can't add more tests, and you should add more tests."

Look at type holes for hints on how to proceed.

Build functions one bit at a time leveraging the compiler can help you with the types of your holes.

Lowercase letters in types are always implicitly bound.

As soon as you have something a bit hard to do, make another function to do that harder thing.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5p8DPbaokE">miniKanren Intro Series #1 (2:06:25)</a>
</summary>
I think it's safe to say that if you know a Lisp you could skip this first video.

miniKanren was originally written as an extension of Scheme, and allows for logic programming.

There's also [microKanren](https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren/blob/master/microKanren.scm) which is
a simplified version, 51 lines of Scheme!

The point is to have a very small language, built around 3 or 4 operations, much like Chess or Go, and from
there build new things and think about the system.

William then names the most used Lisp dialects, talks about the benefits of macros, and briefly explains the
history of Scheme and Racket.

What follows is an explanation of the basics that could be found in a Lisp dialect, and later in Scheme.

Meta circular interpreter, implementing Scheme in Scheme, is what we will do later on in this series.

`list?` is pronounced as "list-uh?".

One thing he pointed out is that you could have something like

```scheme
(cond
  [(= 1 0) 'a]
  [(= 0 0) 'b])
```

to highlight the clauses.

<details>
<summary>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8d8uhU-_SY">miniKanren Intro Series #2 (02:27:09)</a>
</summary>

If you went through [The Little Schemer](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992) you're going to remember
some of the examples he makes.

Building up recursive functions following test cases is a helpful technique to help
yourself when your're stuck not really knowing how you're going to build up the
result, for example in `member` you could use

```scheme
(member 'x '()) ;; #f
(member 'x '(a x f x g)) ;; #t
(member 'foo '(a foo g)) ;; #t
```

and then build from there the base case (first line), the case in which you've found a thing you were looking
for (second line), and the recursive step or else (third line).
As William said earlier you could even pretend you have your function (whishful thinking) and then use
it to fill the gaps, only to go back later to actually code it, in the videos he names such functions as
`dans-member` if, for example, he was midway coding `member`; it's called `dans-` as in Dan's referring to
[Daniel Friedman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_P._Friedman).

He then talks about `map` and `filter`.

The discussion then changes to quotation, so:
 * quote `'`
 * quasiquote ``\`
 * unquote `,`
 * unquote-splicing `,@`

Another interesting point he makes is that

```scheme
(let ((x 7))
x)
```

is the same as

```scheme
((lambda (x) x)
  7)
```

Macros and `define-syntax` are next.

Small introduction to lambda calculus closes the video.

I love how Chomsky talks about what he calls the two tiered system: Bannon-Trump team dominates the headlines,
so whatever they do that's what people look at, one crazy thing after the other make the headlines, and by the time
the new one arrived the old one is forgotten. And while this goes away things like the EPA slash could be safely
made behind the covers.

They proceed talking about Russia interfering with US elections, the Russian border, and North Korea tensions.

"Why are they developing nuclear weapons? It's a deterrent." North Korea will terminate its further development
of nuclear weapons, in return the US should stop threatening maneuvers on the border.
"If the US did decide to use force against North Korea, [...] Seul (confused) be wiped out by mass North Korean artillery".

Nort Korea was destroyed by the most intensive bombing in history, they flattened the country, leaving no targets left.
Then they attacked the dams, which is a war crime of course. [On the subject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_the_Sui-ho_Dam)

Doomsday clock set at 2min 30sec.

Nuclear weapons and Global Warming both are questions of survival and should be the main focus of attention, every Republican candidate
through the election either denied or said we shouldn't do anything about it.

The Sanders achievement, usually "You can pretty well predict electoral outcomes simply by campaign funding alone", is remarkable
as it represents what could happen if just policies are presented, which meet the concerns of the population.

Trump is not going to bring back jobs, what happens then? Something has to be made to maintain control, so scape goating could be an option,
then an alledged terrorist attack, or a staged attack of minor kind. "It's very easy to terrify people".

Iran has very low military spending, even compared to the region standard (Saudi Arabia, Israel, ...) they want to deter attacks.
If they are developing nuclear weeapons is for their deterred strategy.
"Who's concerned about a deterred? Those who want to use force. [...] So yes Iran is the greatest threat to world peace".

"A time comes when silence is betrayal."

"For we are deeply in need of a new way beyond the darkness that seems so close around us", this is so in line with what's happening these days
(early September 2017) between North Korea and US (again).

"And I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like
Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic, destructive suction tube. So I was increasingly compelled to see the war
as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such." which is the same thing one asks themself when questioning Trump's actions these days, is being
so belligerant going to help Americans? Is being openly hostile towards people near US south border going to be any good in the long term?

"So we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has
been unable to seat them together in the same schools. So we watch them in brutal solidarity burning the huts of a poor village, but we realize that
they would hardly live on the same block in Chicago. I could not be silent in the face of such cruel manipulation of the poor."

A clear explanation of seasons and leap day could be found in the video, but it's really the introduction of the Gregorian calendar
that seemed really interesting.
Phenomenal closing though about "THE ride of your life".

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjbkCEkboA8">C_C++ in Spacemacs (40:22)</a>
</summary>

I watched this video because I want to understand what the start of the art is when coding C++ in Spacemacs.

The tip to use C-u to speed up compile time looks great.

Indentation wise he speaks about cstyles, `C-c ,` asks for a style. He goes a lot talking about indentation, since
the team I'm in has its own, or I'm not sure which major one they adhere to, I just moved fast through this section.

For autocompletion there's clang, the de facto standard, which could easily be enabled in Spacemacs.

He skipped debugging and ctags, which I would've loved to hear about though.

NOTES FOR SELF:
 * command to compile
 * with c-u you can have more processes to compile, maybe use that to speed up compile time?
 * autocompletion is not working in your conf, check it

### TDD
<details>
<summary>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AoIfc5NwRks">The Three Laws of TDD (1:06:08)</a>
</summary>

It's an introduction to TDD, with some theory and some examples on how to use it.

 * You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass

Which means you have to write the test first.

 * You are not allowed to write any any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; ad compilation failures are failures
 * You are not allowed to write any any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test

Unit tests as examples of how your code works.
If you write the tests first it's impossible to write a function that's hard to test, functions are written to be easy to test.
The goal of TDD is to create a test suite such that when it passes you can deploy.
A reliable test suite that passes allows you to make decisions.

TDD is a way to incrementally derive solutions to problems.

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecIWPzGEbFc">'Uncle' Bob Martin - 'The Future of Programming' (1:18:20)</a>
</summary>

"Why is it that we programmers are never happy with our language?"
"Why is it that our industry is so incredibly male dominated?"

Number of developers doubles every 5 years, and there are not enough experienced people
to teach the new generations, this is because a great portion of the total is composed by young developers.
So it looks like we are doomed to repeat our errors over and over.

Bob Martin lived 22 orders of magnitude of growth in the hardware.
Software hasn't changed that much: you would recognise the code that Alan Turing wrote in the ACE machine,
you wouldn't like it, but you would recognise it.
You could bring a PDP8 programmer into the present and put them in front of Intellij to code Java.
Our advancement since 1945 is almost entirely about what not to do than what to do:

 * structured programming: don't use unrestrained GOTO
 * functional programming: don't use assignment
 * object programming: don't use pointers to functions

The last 15-20 minutes are particularly interesting, where Bob Martin explains how "we kill people"
and how "we rule the world", and what we could do to limit problems.

</summary>

John Carmack talks about a few concepts, particularly interesting for me were

 * functional programming - functional style allows for self contained code, because it's all about passing something
 in and getting something out, the advanteges of writing code in pure form are a big win especially in the long term
 * Haskell - brutal purity of Haskell [...] multi paradigm as if its a good thing, but it means you could always
do the bad thing if you feel you really need to, and programmers are extremely bad at doing sort of the time
scale integration of the cost of doing something that they know is negative [...] how many times this little bad thing is going
to affect them
 * Lisp
 * Scheme
 * strong and weak typing - everything that's syntactically legal, and the compiler will accept, will eventually
 wind up in your code base and that's why static typing is so valuable because it cuts down on what can make it past

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0">Rails Conf 2012 Keynote: Simplicity Matters by Rich Hickey (36:52)</a>
</summary>

Simple - one fold / braid
Complex - combine together many things / braid them together
Easy - to lie near, at hand

Simple is about interleaving not cardinality: not one thing (ex interfaces with one function) but one role / task / concept / dimension.

Elephant of complexity represents the difficulty in maintaining your code.

Simplicity buys you opportunities, it dominates all other factors.
Once your project reaches a certain size the complexity elephant dominates all other techniques you might be using, tests, agile, nothing
will help you pushing the elephant away.

Pursuing simplicity is about pursuing opportunity.

Examples of simplicity in context:

 â€¢ order should not matter
 â€¢ information is simple, don't put stuff around those, hashmaps are fine
 â€¢ take approaches from sub systems architecture and use them into code

Simplicity is a choice.
Requires vigilance, sensibilities, and care. "Did we entangle anything yesterdayï¼Ÿ Did we complect anything yesterday?".

[The Law of Leaky Abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/) by Joel Spolsky
mentioned in the video.

When is an abstraction leaking? What does it mean?

> Exposing internals.

> An example: a specification which is short and understandable but doesn't completely describe the behaviour of
> the software, and then you have a more complex one which "in this particular case it doesn't work like that", you have to
> do extra things to fix it up.
> When you have these two, and you want the simplest one but the second one is the one that's implemented that's the leak.

</summary>
 
Basically this talk gives you the tools necessary to answer the "Should I address technical debt? If so, where?".

Adam proposes a way to decide when and where to tackle technical debt. He talks about how git, thanks to its informations about
code changes over time, can point the developer to where an action is mostly needed.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SdUewLCHWvU&feature=youtu.be&t=612) he shows an interesting pattern shared by three
radically different codebases.

He then speaks about [normalization of deviance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_%28sociology%29), or how people come
to accept what they experience in their every day lives.

### Types

<details>
<summary>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVuEPwNuCHw">Types, and why you should care (1:04:05)</a>
</summary>
 Speaker is [Yaron Minsky](https://github.com/yminsky), the one who brought OCaml into Jane Street.
 
 * values - data that flows around in your program
 * variables - a name that points to a value
 * expressions - a collection of syntax that has some meaning
 * types - cathegorisation system for values, grouping related values together
 
In untyped languages values have types, while in typed language values variables expressions have types.

```JS
var x = 5; // value has a type in JavaScript 
```

```Java
int x = 5; // variable and value have a type in Java
```

Statically typed languages, the code that you wrote (the text) has a meaning associated.

Types help communicating intentions and in detecting errors.

There's also [a discussion on HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16622684) about this.

</summary>
"What is a type system?"
 
In all la guages we have 
 * Data
 * Operations
Not all available operations make sense to all kinds of data. "If you use incompatible pieces of data for your operations 
you will get a representation error".

"Programming languages use a type system to look at a program and determine if a representation error will happen or not".

What strategies could we use to handle those representation errors?

Well you could:

 * perform a type check before running the code - Java - Strong
 * have unpredictable error set and implicit conversions - JavaScript - Weak
 * tag code and try to infer if the behaviour will be correct or not - Static
 * generate code to keep track of the data - Python - Dynamic

### TypeScript

<summary>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ChtcZmb3dI">What's New In TypeScript (1:00:36)</a>
</summary>
`.d.ts` files are called declaration files.
 
 TypeScript targets EcmaScript 5. So for example arrow functions are compiled into regular functions. But it's a
 configuration setting that could be changed int tsconfig.json.
 
 Exhaustiveness checking is introduced later on after some examples where he discusses a possible functional
 approach to the usual `Shape`, `Rectangle`, `Circle`, `Square` OOP scenario.
 
 Documentation pops automatically up when including a library and having its declaration files with type definitions.
